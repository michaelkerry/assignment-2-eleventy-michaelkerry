                <br/>
                <p>During World War II the remote Aleutian Islands, home to the Unangax̂ (Aleut) people for over 8,000 years, became a fiercely contested battleground in the Pacific. This thousand-mile-long archipelago saw invasion by Japanese forces, the occupation of two islands; a mass relocation of Unangax̂ civilians; a 15-month air war; and one of the deadliest battles in the Pacific Theater.</p>

The island can be reached by commercial or charter air flights from Anchorage. Commercial flights to Unalaska include Pen Air and Alaska Airlines. The Alaska Marine Highway is a ferry service that is operated by the state that can be used to reach the island. The Aleutian World War II Visitor Center is located at the Unalaska airport.</p>
